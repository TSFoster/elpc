Fast becoming one of the most popular racket sports in the world, [pickleball](https://www.lta.org.uk/play/ways-to-play/pickleball/) brings together some of the best elements of tennis, badminton and table tennis, into a fun and exciting game for people of all ages and abilities.

Played on a court the same size as a badminton court – and using a shorter tennis-style net – players use paddles to hit a plastic ball between one another. You can play as both singles and doubles, and it’s a great way to exercise with friends and family or meet new people.

It is a game that is appropriate for players of all ages and skill levels. Rules for pickleball are simple, making it a great introductory sport. It can also be quite the challenging, fast-paced, and competitive game when people become more experienced at playing

Whether you’re a beginner who just wants to learn a new sport for fun, or you’re a seasoned player who craves the thrill of more competitive play, pickleball offers something for everyone.
