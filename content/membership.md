ELPC is a friendly volunteer run club.  Our aim to provide members and guests of all ages and standards the opportunity to develop their game through social and competitive play while respecting each other and having fun. 

Annual membership is available at Â£15 for which members benefit from reduce rate sessions, member only coaching sessions, access to the club ball machine and special member only festivals and tournaments.
