We have two Pickleball Scotland qualified coaches and they provide a variety of coaching options for members.

The club runs a weekly coached session for 20 members to learn and practice specific skills.  We also run blocks of coaching for groups of 4 so that they can develop skills together and have more interaction with the coach.

Our coaches also offer private coaching for any members wishing to work with them directly.

In the run up to major events we run practice sessions for members who have entered the event so that they can prapare for the challenge ahead.
