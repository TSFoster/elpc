We have three **Pickleball Scotland** qualified coaches who offer a range of coaching options to suit our members' needs.

Each week, the club hosts a coached session for up to 20 members, focusing on specific skills and techniques. Additionally, we offer coaching blocks for small groups of 4, allowing for more personalized attention and interaction with the coach.

For members who prefer one-on-one guidance, our coaches also provide private coaching sessions tailored to individual needs.

Leading up to major events, we organize practice sessions for those participating, helping them prepare and refine their skills for the challenges ahead.
