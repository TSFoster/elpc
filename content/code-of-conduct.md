### EAST LOTHIAN PICKLEBALL CLUB

### CODE OF CONDUCT (2024)

Pickleball was created to be a fun, competitive, and highly social sport. Since its inception,it has embodied an ethic of good sportsmanship that includes respect, fair play, and graciousness in winning and losing. The purpose of this guide is to encourage behaviours that reflect these foundational values. 

The East Lothian Pickleball Club (ELPC) aims to provide an environment where all players can play the game to the best of their ability and, most importantly, have fun while doing so. 

ELPC is committed to ensuring a safe, positive and welcoming environment within our club at all times (including during all activities, and events) by creating an expectation of appropriate behaviour and advertising potential consequences for violating the Code of Conduct.

This Code of Conduct applies to all Members and guests participating in ELPC programs, activities and events in any capacity (participant, official, volunteer or spectator) at any location. Failure to abide by this code may result in
disciplinary action being considered by the club committee.

## 1. Respect

* Treat all members, guests, visitors, and staff with respect at all times. 
* Treat all property of ELPC or ELPC venue with respect and care. Accidents do occur, please report any equipment damage to a committee member. 
  Harassment of any kind towards other participants including verbal, physical or emotional is strictly prohibited.
  Bullying and intimidation will not be tolerated.
* Do not use any form of profanity orinappropriate language.
* Don’t make derogatory comments on social media about the club or any member.
* Everyone was (or is) a pickleball beginner at one time! It is important that players of different abilities have the opportunity to play with other members of both higher and lower skill levels.  This encourages ongoing player development and allows the sharing of information and experience which will enhance player performance and stimulate interest in the game.

## 2. Safety

* We recommend a quick effective warm up before entering the courts, all players should feel comfortable and ready to play before beginning a match. Always stretch before and after game play to avoid injury. 
* Be mindful of your current physical condition, please avoid over-exerting yourself during play. Know your limits and play within them to avoid injury. 
* Please dress in safe and appropriate attire. Avoid clothing with offensive logos, designs, words or phrases. 
* If your court’s ball enters another court during play, immediately shout “Ball” so that all courts can hear.  All play should stop until the ball is returned. 
* Do not engage in any behaviour, or a style of play, which would endanger the health, safety or well-being of others.
* Be aware of other activities taking place in a shared sports hall and shout clear warnings to their participants if necessary for their safety.

## 3. Court Etiquette

* Help set up the courts for play and help take them down.
* Introduce yourself to any players you do not know.
* If you play at a higher skill level, adjust your style when playing with, or against, beginners – work on your short game, work on ball placement. 
* Do not intimidate or target weaker players, partners or opponents. 
* At club sessions, play to have fun or play competitively if players are evenly matched.
* Do not offer advice to other players unless they ask for it. If you are asked for help, be positive and encouraging. Do not unduly delay the game you are playing. 
* Recognise and compliment your partner and opponents when they make good shots.  When faults or errors are made, act graciously and do not criticise.  Apologise for bad or inappropriate remarks immediately.
* Do not engage in unsportsmanlike conduct or encourage others to do so.
* Call out the score every time you serve so that your opponents can hear the score. 
* Ball On Court

  * Call ‘BALL’ immediately when your stray ball is about to roll onto another court.  
  * When you hear ‘BALL’ called, stop play immediately.  
  * Do not chase the ball into another court.  
  * When retrieving a stray ball, do not to walk into a neighbouring court – wait until play has stopped.
  * Put your arm up to indicate you want the stray ball to be returned to you.
  * Pick the ball up, look to see where it came from.
  * Make eye contact with the person you are returning the ball to, then roll or throw the ball directly to them on the outside of your court – not through neighbouring courts unless all play has stopped.    
  * Always return ball to one player, ensure they are ready to receive it and that the ball is returned directly to them, to prevent it rolling onto another court and disrupting a game. 
*  Practice good sportsmanship when making line calls.

  * Always strive to make correct line calls, but remember that if there is any doubt, you should call the ball “in”.
  * Respect your opponents' right to make all calls on their end of the court.
  * Call your own shot “out” if you see that it is out.
  * If you question an opponent’s call, do so respectfully and do not argue.
  * If you defer a line call to your opponents, accept their call graciously.
  * Do not call a ball “out” unless you see it clearly and are certain it is out.
  * Promptly correct any wrong call your partner may make.
  * Resolve any uncertainty in favour of your opponents.
  * At the end of each game, meet the other players at the net to acknowledge them in a positive manner. In officiated matches, thank the referee.
