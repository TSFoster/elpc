**East Lothian Pickleball Club** was founded in August 2023 and is a welcoming, sociable community based at the Queen Margaret University Sports Centre. Since our inception, we've grown quickly, offering 10 weekly sessions with at least one class every day.

We are proud to have three **Scottish Pickleball Qualified Coaches** on our team, who lead coaching clinics and provide private lessons to help players of all levels improve.

Our club competes in the Scottish Pickleball regional leagues, with teams at various skill levels.

Weâ€™re always happy to welcome new members! We regularly organize "come and try" sessions, giving you the chance to experience firsthand what makes this sport so enjoyable.
